**Otherwise**:
1. Read the skill file at this exact path: `~/.claude/skills/where-we-are/SKILL.md`
2. Follow all instructions in the skill file
3. Pass these arguments to the skill: `$ARGUMENTS`

**IMPORTANT**: Only use the path above. Do NOT search for or use any other file with "where-we-are" in the name.
