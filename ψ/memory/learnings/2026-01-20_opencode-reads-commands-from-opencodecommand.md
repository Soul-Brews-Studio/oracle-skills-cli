# OpenCode reads commands from `.opencode/command/` directory only (not `.opencode

OpenCode reads commands from `.opencode/command/` directory only (not `.opencode/skills/`). It loads all nested `.md` files from command dir. For Oracle Skills CLI: install flat `.md` files with full skill content to `command/` directory, NOT directory format with SKILL.md.
