# RRR Ceremony vs Value Balance

**Date**: 2026-01-23
**Context**: oracle-skills-cli documentation polish session
**Confidence**: Medium

## Key Learning

Full retrospective templates are valuable for substantial sessions but can feel ceremonial for micro-sessions (under 30 minutes with minimal changes). The overhead of filling every section - AI Diary, Honest Feedback, 3 Friction Points, Metrics - can exceed the actual work done.

However, there's value in consistent practice. Even a "heavy" rrr for a small session:
1. Captures context that would otherwise be lost
2. Maintains the habit of reflection
3. Documents the decision to make small changes (which often compound)

The tension isn't about skipping rrr for small sessions, but about recognizing when the ceremony serves the work vs when it becomes the work.

## The Pattern

```
Session length < 30 min AND changes < 5 files
  → Consider: Is full rrr adding insight or just checking boxes?

If insight: Full rrr
If checkbox: Maybe note in previous session's "Next Steps" or batch with next session
```

## Why This Matters

Retrospectives exist to create institutional memory and enable learning. When they become rote, they lose power. The friction points section is most vulnerable - forcing 3 points when there's only 1 real one dilutes the signal.

Better to have fewer, meaningful retrospectives than many formulaic ones. But the discipline of regular reflection shouldn't be abandoned - just calibrated.
